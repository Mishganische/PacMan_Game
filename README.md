Terminal-based Pacman is a text version of the classic arcade game that runs directly in the terminal. 
The player controls Pacman, collects dots on the map and tries to avoid collisions with ghosts. The goal is to clear the field of all dots using strategy and quick reactions. 
Despite the simple interface, the game retains the tension and atmosphere of the original. It is great for learning algorithms and practicing logic in a game format.
